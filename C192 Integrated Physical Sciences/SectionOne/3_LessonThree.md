## Lesson 3.6 Direction and Magnitude of Net Force

This text discusses the concept of forces in action, emphasizing the importance of considering all forces acting on an object to determine its motion. It introduces the idea that an object accelerates in the direction of the net force acting on it, which is the combination of all forces. The text explains how forces in the same direction add up to produce a stronger net force, while opposing forces of equal magnitude cancel each other out, resulting in balanced forces and no acceleration. The example of a shopping cart being pushed forward and pulled backward illustrates these principles. The concept of zero net force, where balanced forces lead to no acceleration, is connected to Newton's first law of motion. The text concludes by highlighting that a non-zero net force, indicating unbalanced forces, causes acceleration.

### Learn By Doing

Do this thing: 
Run the PhET simulation "Forces and Motion: Basics." 1  
1. Click on the "Net Force" tab.
2. Check the "Sum of Forces" and "Values" boxes in the top right of the screen.
3. Drag one of the blue figures to one of the knots on the left-hand side of the rope.
4. Answer the first question in the activity below.

Q: In which direction do you think the cart will move? Why? Press the "Go" button and observe what happens. Was your prediction correct?

A: Objects accelerate in the direction of the net force. In this case, the net force is to the left, so the cart should accelerate (start moving) to the left.

Do this thing: 
Click on the orange reset button in the top right corner of the screen.
1. Drag a blue figure to the rope on the left side of the cart.
2. Drag a red figure of the same size as the blue figure to the right-hand side of the cart.
3. Make a prediction about the net force on the cart. Check the "Sum of Forces" box to see if you are correct.
4. Answer the question in the activity below.

Q: In which direction do you think the cart will move? Why? Press the "Go" button and observe what happens. Was your prediction correct?

A: Objects accelerate in the direction of the net force. In this case, the net force is zero, so the cart should not accelerate. It should remain at rest.

### Did I Get This?
Q: What is true about the net force from two equal forces in opposite directions?
 
A:
- [x] The net force is zero.
- [ ] The net force is to the left.
- [ ] The net force is twice as strong.
- [ ] The net force is to the right.

Q: Forces acting on an object that combine to give zero net force are said to be balanced. Why would that term be appropriate?

A:
- [ ] The forces look nice and are harmonious.
- [ ] The forces point in opposite directions and cause acceleration to the right.
- [x] The forces cancel each other and cause zero acceleration.
- [ ] The forces are equal in magnitude and cause acceleration to the left.

Let us consider the coffee mug again. The force from the hand holding it exerts a force pushing it up. Its weight exerts a force on it pulling it down. The two forces combine to produce a net force.

Q: When the two forces are equal, what is the resulting net force?

A:
- [ ] Upward
- [ ] Downward
- [x] Zero

Q: When you first exert extra force upward, what happens to the weight of the cup?

A:
- [x] It remains the same.
- [ ] It increases.
- [ ] It decreases.

Q: The weight of the cup is less than the force from your hand. What is the net force on the cup?

A:
- [ ] Zero
- [ ] Downward
- [x] Upward

Q: How does the cup accelerate as a result?

A:
- [x] Upward
- [ ] Downward

### Key Terms

- balanced forces: forces that combine to produce a net force of zero
- zero net force: there is no net force and therefore no acceleration
- non-zero net force: there is a net force, so acceleration is possible
