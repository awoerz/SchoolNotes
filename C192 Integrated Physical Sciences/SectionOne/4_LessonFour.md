### Key Terms

- hypothesis: a testable statement about how something in nature works
- law: a concise statement that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments and describes a widespread pattern in nature
- theory: a statement that explains a wide range of observations and that is supported by a large body of scientific evidence

## Lesson 4.2 Newton's First Law of Motion

### Learn By Doing

Statement: A spaceship is on a robotic mission to an outer planet of our solar system.

Q: Is it necessary for the spacecraft to continue firing its engines to keep it moving toward its destination?

A:
- [ ] Yes. An object must continue being pushed to keep it moving.
- [ ] No. The rocket engine provides a net force after being turned off.
- [ ] Yes. Friction would bring it to a stop otherwise.
- [x] No. The spacecraft remains in motion when no net force is acting on it.

According to Newton’s first law, it will remain in motion at constant velocity.

Q: Two people are both pushing on a ball with equal force in opposite directions. On person suddenly stops pushing. What will happen to the ball?

A: 
- [x] It will begin accelerating.
- [ ] It will begin moving with constant speed.
- [ ] It will immediately fall due to gravity.
- [ ] It will begin to reach terminal velocity.

A non-zero net force results in the acceleration of an object.

Q: NASA has used this same idea to “weigh” astronauts during space missions. They developed a device in which the astronaut glides back and forth by being pushed and pulled by springs. The springs apply the same force during each swing. The velocity of the astronaut is constantly changing as the force from the spring accelerates him first one way, then the other. If the astronaut has lost weight while in space, would the spring accelerate him back and forth more easily or less easily?

A: 
- [x] More easily
- [ ] Less easily
- [ ] The same as before\

Lower mass means less inertia, and the same force can move the astronaut back and forth more, producing greater acceleration for the same force.

### Key Terms

Key Terms

- Newton's first law: the net force on an object is the cause of its acceleration
- Inertia: the tendency to keep the same motion, to remain at rest, or to maintain the same velocity

## Lesson 4.3 Newton's Second Law of Motion

### Learn By Doing

Q: Question: Suppose the cart, initially at rest, is pushed with a constant force for a time and then is suddenly no longer being pushed (click on the cart to stop it). Can you predict how the cart's speed will change while it is pushed, and then while it is no longer pushed?

My Answer: speed will increase if there is net force greater than the mass of the object and will decrease if when force is less than the mass which happens when it is no longer being pushed. 

Book Answer: The cart's speed continues increasing as long as it is pushed because an object with a net force acting on it continues accelerating in the direction of the force for as long as the force acts. When the cart is no longer pushed, it continues at a constant speed because any object in motion with no net force acting on it continues moving at the same velocity.

Q: Suppose the same force accelerates a much larger mass than before for the same four seconds or so. Predict how the final speed attained after the four seconds would differ for the greater mass. Would this correspond to larger or smaller acceleration? Why?

My Answer: Because Acceleration is also equal to Net Force divided by Mass, the same Net Force divided by more Mass, would mean the overall Acceleration is smaller. This means that the speed of the larger mass would be smaller than the speed of the smaller mass.

Book Answer: The speed attained would be smaller. The same force acting on a larger mass changes the velocity less, producing a smaller final velocity. Because the change in velocity is smaller over the same time for greater mass, the acceleration is smaller.

Q: Suppose you applied a small force (of about 50 N) again for only about four seconds. Suppose you then started over and repeated the experiment, but with a larger force than before acting for only about the same four seconds. How do you predict the speed produced by four seconds of the larger force would differ from the speed produced by four seconds of the smaller force? How would the acceleration therefore differ? Why?

My Answer: Greater force over the same mass would still result in higher acceleration meaning the higher the force on an object, the greater the acceleration be because Acceleration is equal to Net Force divided by Mass

Book Answer: The cart and its cargo would end up moving faster if a larger force acts on it for the same four seconds. That would mean the acceleration produced by the larger force is greater, because the velocity changes much more in the same amount of time from the larger force.
