### What I Learned
There were actually two meetings to revise the Articles of Confederation, the first being in Annapolis, Maryland. Most of the states didn't send delegates because they suck I guess and this caused Alexander Hamilton and James Madison to request EVERY state send delgates to Philly the next year. 

Rhode Island, being the joker they are, didn't send a delegate to the Philly connvention but the peeps that were there said, you know what, this is stupid, the Articles suck, time to make a new document becase a complete consensus is never going to work and we really need to fix these Articles. Everyone agreed to some compromises which will be discussed in following sections in more detail but include these: 

- changes in the structure of the legislative branch and how representation would be determined for each state
- the necessary powers for the branches of government
- the balance of power between the national government and state governments, which, under the Articles of Confederation, tilted heavily toward the individual states

### Did I complete the learning objectives for this section?
Describe the major compromises that occurred during the Constitutional Convention.
There were 3:
- updates to the legislaative branch, resulting in modern congress with a more representative way of representing the people. 
- the states giving up more power to the fed, which the material states was "more balanced"
- and giving the federal government some actual executive powers to fulfill their legislative powers as they were provided by the Constitution. In other words, the fed got teeth.

### Do I have any further questions or thoughts?
Yeah, this section should probably have been just the introduction to the next 3 sections.
