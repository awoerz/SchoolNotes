## <a id="intro">2 Introduction</a>
This section is really about showing why there are two chambers of congress and why they each represent the people differently.

## Learning Objectives:
Describe the similarities and differences of the New Jersey and Virginia Plans.

## <a id="svl">7.1 The Question of Representation - Small States versus Large States</a>

### What I Learned
55 delegates in total at Philly in 1787 for Constitutional Convention.

Small states feared being steam-rolled by larger ones and all states worried that slavery would be permanent or outlawed all together.

#### Virginia Plan
Virginia wanted a bicameral legislatrue with the number of reps based on state population. The "lower chamber" reps would be by popular vote and those reps would then chose their reps in the "upper chamber' from propsed candidates by the state's existing legislature. The reps had no term limits. 

#### New Jersey Plan
NJ wanted a unicameral legislature and each state would have one vote each. 

obviously the larger states didn't like NJ's plan because it gave small states the same legislative power as the larger ones.
