## <a id="social-contract">2.1 The Social Contract</a>

### What I Learned
Prior to the Enlightenment, the general understanding of society was that it was natural or created and our roles and obligations as people was assumed. 

#### Thomas Hobbes (The Leviathan 1651)
- Social Contract Theory
- Argues that society is not natural and infelxible, but created by humans to resolve the general problems of life
- Humans are passibe members, but it's creators and therefore in charge of society rather than society governing them. 


Democratic governments for societal governance is preferable owing to it following the throughline that society is created by it's people and so should it's government. 

#### Direct Democracy vs Representative Democracy
- **Direct Democracy** means everyone involved in all decisions
- **Representative Democracy** means some invovled in decisions as elected to represent people by democrative election

Social contract can be flawed in that everyone must be in agreement and posess the same abilitys and purpose. Because consensus is managed by democratic political processes, democratic policies do not always result in peace. 

### Learning Check Questions

## <a id="son-nr">2.2 The State of Nature and Natural Rights</a>
### What I Learned

#### State of Nature
- A condition in which humans live idividually and solitarily prior to the existence of society. 

Author of the material states that Locke and Hobes start with the state of nature and that it is an "acknowledged fiction" but all assuming it exists makes human existance easier.

A person's personal belief is vital to human existence; therefore it is important in how humans define themselves as individuals. Natuarl rights are vital for the protection of a person's indiviudal existence and the definition of their individual identity

The book pits Hobbes and Locke against one another in how they define the state of nature. It is important to note that the two major works cited here are Hobbes' Leviathan in 1651 and Locke's Two Tretises of Government in 1689. These works are 38 years apart and Locke's *Two Tretises* was published 10 years after the death of Hobbes. Meaning they weren't contemporaries and that this is a somewhat apples to oranges comparison. 

Hobbes' view on the state of nature: 
-  Life is the key consideration and life can be protected by the social contract proposing a monarchy to maintain life. 

Locke's view on the state of nature:
- Quality of Life, rather than just life, is the key consideration. Liberty and Property a ther most important natural rights to be protected and therefore a social contract that seeks to provide basic protection from harm while permitting individuals to purue their own lives as they see fit is best. 


### Learning Check Questions
1. Which of the following did John Locke view as the most important protections under the social contract
- Liberty and Property - John Locke beleive that liberty and property are both natural rights and it is the government's job to protect them.

2. Which of these accurately describes John Locke's view of the state of nature?
- The state of nature was peaceful and consisted of rational human beings - Even though this was John Locke's belief, he also argued that life in the state of nature was "incovenient".

3. According to John Locke, how much authority should society have over its citizens under the social contract? 
- Limited authority - Locke believed that the social contract should provide a society in which the society has no more power than is necessary to regulate the natural rights and co-existence of its citizens.

### Key Terms
#### State of Nature
- A theory on how people might have lived before societies came into existence.
