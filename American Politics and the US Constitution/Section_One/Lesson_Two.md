### What I Learned
Prior to the Enlightenment, the general understanding of society was that it was natural or created and our roles and obligations as people was assumed. 

#### Thomas Hobbes (The Leviathan)
- Social Contract Theory
- Argues that society is not natural and infelxible, but created by humans to resolve the general problems of life
- Humans are passibe members, but it's creators and therefore in charge of society rather than society governing them. 


Democratic governments for societal governance is preferable owing to it following the throughline that society is created by it's people and so should it's government. 

#### Direct Democracy vs Representative Democracy
- **Direct Democracy** means everyone involved in all decisions
- **Representative Democracy** means some invovled in decisions as elected to represent people by democrative election

Social contract can be flawed in that everyone must be in agreement and posess the same abilitys and purpose. Because consensus is managed by democratic political processes, democratic policies do not always result in peace.
