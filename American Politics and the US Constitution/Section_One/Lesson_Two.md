## <a id="social-contract">2.1 The Social Contract</a>

### What I Learned
Prior to the Enlightenment, the general understanding of society was that it was natural or created and our roles and obligations as people was assumed. 

#### Thomas Hobbes (The Leviathan 1651)
- Social Contract Theory
- Argues that society is not natural and infelxible, but created by humans to resolve the general problems of life
- Humans are passibe members, but it's creators and therefore in charge of society rather than society governing them. 


Democratic governments for societal governance is preferable owing to it following the throughline that society is created by it's people and so should it's government. 

#### Direct Democracy vs Representative Democracy
- **Direct Democracy** means everyone involved in all decisions
- **Representative Democracy** means some invovled in decisions as elected to represent people by democrative election

Social contract can be flawed in that everyone must be in agreement and posess the same abilitys and purpose. Because consensus is managed by democratic political processes, democratic policies do not always result in peace. 

### Learning Check Questions
1. What is it called when people make an agreement between themseleves and the government? 
    - A social contract - in general, a contract is an agreement between two parties. The terms of the agreement between a government and its people are an ongoing negotiation.

2. According to social contract theory, what is the origin of society?
    - Society is created by humans to resolve the problems they face. Social contract theory argues that we create societ to meet particular needs we individually possess and share with others.

### Key Terms
#### Social Contract
- A basic agreement between people and their government in which citizens consent to be governed, as long as the governemnt protects their natural rights; the social contract provides a definition of human nature, specifies the natural rights to be protected, and describes the share interests of the citizens

#### Social Contract Theory
- The idea that society is not natural, but created by people

#### Direct Democracy
- A form of democracy where people participate personally in making government decisions instead of choosing represnetatives to do this for them

#### Enlightenment
- A period of Western European history following the Middle Ages; the source of people's ideas about natural rights

## <a id="son-nr">2.2 The State of Nature and Natural Rights</a>
### What I Learned

#### State of Nature
- A condition in which humans live idividually and solitarily prior to the existence of society. 

Author of the material states that Locke and Hobes start with the state of nature and that it is an "acknowledged fiction" but all assuming it exists makes human existance easier.

A person's personal belief is vital to human existence; therefore it is important in how humans define themselves as individuals. Natuarl rights are vital for the protection of a person's indiviudal existence and the definition of their individual identity

The book pits Hobbes and Locke against one another in how they define the state of nature. It is important to note that the two major works cited here are Hobbes' Leviathan in 1651 and Locke's Two Tretises of Government in 1689. These works are 38 years apart and Locke's *Two Tretises* was published 10 years after the death of Hobbes. Meaning they weren't contemporaries and that this is a somewhat apples to oranges comparison. 

Hobbes' view on the state of nature: 
-  Life is the key consideration and life can be protected by the social contract proposing a monarchy to maintain life. 

Locke's view on the state of nature:
- Quality of Life, rather than just life, is the key consideration. Liberty and Property a ther most important natural rights to be protected and therefore a social contract that seeks to provide basic protection from harm while permitting individuals to purue their own lives as they see fit is best. 


### Learning Check Questions
1. Which of the following did John Locke view as the most important protections under the social contract
- Liberty and Property - John Locke beleive that liberty and property are both natural rights and it is the government's job to protect them.

2. Which of these accurately describes John Locke's view of the state of nature?
- The state of nature was peaceful and consisted of rational human beings - Even though this was John Locke's belief, he also argued that life in the state of nature was "incovenient".

3. According to John Locke, how much authority should society have over its citizens under the social contract? 
- Limited authority - Locke believed that the social contract should provide a society in which the society has no more power than is necessary to regulate the natural rights and co-existence of its citizens.

### Key Terms
#### State of Nature
- A theory on how people might have lived before societies came into existence. 

## <a id="sc-cpr">2.3 Social Contract and Consensual Political Rule</a>
### What I Learned
Social contract break down when not everyone agrees because if we agree they are created by people, they only work when their is a consensus. The material states that when natural rights of some are denied it results in enequality. 
#### Material's logic
different -> inequality -> social and political conflict -> The Civil War

I can follow this logic to some degree but this is pretty intense if I'm being honest. I'm not sure I can jump through all the hoops the same way. I feel like I'm being set up to disagree with the John Locke and the founding fathers at some point or that a gotcha is going to come out of nowhere and tell me America sucks.

The material follows up with other major political movements resulting from a lack of consensus and resulting in a change of social contract: 

- the labor movement
- women's suffrage
- the civil rights movement
- the women's liberation movement

The material now goes into the political spectrum and calls out the TEA ("Taxed Enough Already") party as being a conservative party that leans mostly into the Republican Party and elected Donald Trump. I kind of hate this simplified view and this is not 100% true. So this is the *"gotcha"* I saw coming. 

It then goes on to describe other groups on the left-wing side of things but does not negatively associate any of them with some of the less than admirable things they've done like they did with trying to link the TEA party to Donald Trump. Those groups were LGBTA+, Occupy Wall Street, and BLM. We all know BLM along with Antifa was responsible for large swaths of violence and destrution during the riots of 2020 and 2021. 

Holy freaking crap! They are talking about Kim Davis not issuing a marriage license to a gay couple in KY even though that case is very nuanced, not to mention KY had it's own laws or in the context of this material, it's own social contract. The material is attempting to show examples of "softening / rejection" of the American social contract by groups on the right and left, but it is using vague examples that I don't think prove the point they are trying to make. Where did they get this writer, a lefty junior college? 

It does end by stating that social contract is ongoing in our political process and I tend to agree with this as long as we continue to agree that society is created by people for people and not a natural outcome of life. It seems this first question posed in Lesson One has now been assumed to be that society is created by people, for people.

### Key Terms
#### Political Spectrum
- A way to classify political ideologies; the American political spectrum consists primarily of liberalism(left) and conservatism(right), with most Americans identifying themselves as conservative, liberal, or moderate(center); in general people on the left prefer more governmental involvement, while those on the right prefer less

^ I love how it points out that the left prefers more governmental involvement but I can't wait for this material to try and paint the right as pro-facist. 

## <a id="q-s">Quiz and Summary</a>
### Summary and Takeaways
- Society is not natural or God-given. It is intentionally designed to further individuals' shared interests. <- BOOM, the material finally stated outright that it is leaning towards this view although it was never "proven".
- Society is defined by a social contract which is based on an understanding of what it means to be human (i.e., human nature) and of what natural rights humans posses.
- The prupose of social contract is to enhance the potentional of human nature by protecting natural rights. 
- While any form of government can be used, the optimal form of government is representative democracy (i.e., republic.)
- Social contracts require continual renegotiation to remain relevant to present-day circumstances. This renegotiation, which can cause conflict, is managed through the democratic process. Failure to renegotiate the terms of a social contract can lead to the disintegration of society. <- This last point follows a train of logic that I find hard to wrap my head around and again, it was not proven as much as it was stated prior in the section. This still feels like a setup.

### Quiz
1. Which three statements describe characteristics of a social contract? **Choose 3 ansers**.
    - [x] Provides a definition of human nature
    - [x] Specifies the natural rights that are to be protected
    - [x] Describes the share interests of the citizens
    - [ ] Is a manifestation of the will of God


## Personal Follow Up
### Did I complete the learning objectives for this section?
1. Describe the development and influence of the social contract theory.

### Do I have any further questions?
1. Where can I get proof that society is created by people and not God as the reading material purports? This sounds like a philisophical qustion that requires more thought expiriments and explanation.
2. What is the material setting me up to believe with the notion that society must always be "in-flux" with it's values? It feels like at some point they are going to leverage this point (again, not a proven point) to make me feel like the Constitution is always up for debate and should be changed. I understand ammendments are a thing, but it is important to note that one side of the aisle very much believes the constitution to be a "living breathing document". They believe they can change it on a whim and that society dictates at all times what rights are actually natural rights and which are rights that are "allowed" by government. Very, very, very interested to find out if my hunch is true.
