# Lesson 1 Introduction

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe the influence of Enlightenment ideas on the founding doucuments (of the United States). 

## 1.1 The Enlightenment in a Nutshell

### What I Learned
#### Three major players in the Enligthenment
1. John Locke (Two Tretises of Government - 1689)
	- Natural Rights: Liberty and Property
2. Montesquieu (The spirit of the Laws - 1748)
    - Separation of powers; legislative, executive and judicial.
    - Due Process
3. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations - 1776)
    - People freely pursing their personal economic interests leads to maximal wealth for a society

## Key Terms
### Natural Rights
    - The rights to life, liberty and property; believed to be given by God; no government may take these rights away
### State of Nature
    - The idea of living under no government and having no rules for society
### Due Process
    - The requirement that the government, when dealing with people, has a fair procedure that applies equally to all
### Chamber
    - One of the houses of a legislature (in the U.S., Congress has two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate)

## Personal Follow Up
### Did I complete the learning objectives for this section?
1. Describe the influence of Enlightenment ideas on the founding doucuments (of the United States). 
    -  The notion of natural rights from John Locke and what those rights are can be found in the Declaration of independence. Montesquieu's ideas of separation of powers can be found in the constitution. Adam Smith's ideas on a free pursuit of wealth show a preliminary leaning towards the free market economy of the United States.

### Do I have any further questions?
1. How did the early United States become a free market economy?
2. Are there any documents from the founding fathers about how the economy should work or is this outlined in the Constitution and I'm just dumb?
