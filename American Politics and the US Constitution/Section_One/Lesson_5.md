## <a id="intro">2 Introduction</a>

They author already droned on about this in the last section, I have no idea why there's a whole section. This is a stupid section and my note taking is going to reflect that. 

## Learning Objectives:
Describe the problems associated with the Articles of Confederation.

## <a id="pran">5.1 Power To Raise an Army or Navy</a>

### What I Learned
I learned NOTHING NEW, they go on about how the government could decleare war but not raise an army. No duh this was a bad idea. 

### Learning Check Question
1. Even though the national government had the power to declare war under the Articles of Confederation, why was the power limited and ultimately ineffective?
- [ ] Individual states had the power to disagree with the national government and overrule its decision to go to war.
- [ ] There was no money to cover the costs of war.
- [x] There was no national army, so the national government had to rely on the individual states to allow its soldiers to participate.
- [ ] There was no chief executive who could decide on a strategy for fighting wars.

## <a id="rt">5.2 Regulating Trade</a>

### What I Learned
This section just makes an odd statement how goods could not be taxed by the foreign government so Brittish goods were imported and made cheaper causing small business to not do well. I have no idea to the legitimacy of this statement as there are no citations in this section and it's super short. It makes me believe the author is grasping at straws to fill a quota for writing this section of the material. 

### Learning Check Question
1. Why was the inability to regulate trade among the states a weakness of the national government under the Articles of Confederation?
- [ ] It prevented lower priced international goods from being sold in the United States.
- [ ] It allowed foreign nations to undermine the national government by encouraging the individual states to declare independence and become their own countries.
- [ ] The inability to regulate trade among the states was not a weakness of the national government under the Articles of Confederation.
- [x] It allowed the states to make their own agreements with other countries.

# ^THIS SECTION SUCKED! 
The question doesn't match the content and it is making crap up about a supposed "weakness". Allowing states to make their own agreements with foreign countries isn't intrinsically bad and the book offers no reason for why this is a weakness of the Articles.

## <a id="pac">5.3 Problems with the Articles of Confederation</a>

### What I Learned
Continued list of complaints already outlined in other sections. This is pointless to take notes on. 

| Weakness of the Articles of Confederation | Why Was This a Problem? |
|--------------|--------------|
|The national government could not impose taxes on citizens. It could only request money from the states | Requests for money were usually not honored. As a result, the national government was left underfunded and unable to pay for national defense or fulfill its other responsibilities. Also, foreign governments were reluctant to loan money to the U.S. for fear that it would not be able to repay those loans. The currency of the U.S. became worthless. |
| The national government could not regulate foreign trade or interstate commerce | The government could not prevent foreign countries from hurting American competitors by shipping inexpensive products to the United States. It could not prevent states from passing laws that interfered with domestic trade. As a result, many local farmers and business owners failed.|
| The national government could not raise an army. It had to request that the states send men. | State governments could choose not to honor Congress's request for troops. This would make it hard to defend the nation.|
| Each state had only one vote in Congress regardless of its size. | Populous states (states with larger populations) had disproportionate representation. |
| The Articles could not be changed without a unanimous vote to do so. | Problems with the Articles could not be easily fixed. |
| There was no national judicial system. | Judiciaries are important enforcers of national government power.|
