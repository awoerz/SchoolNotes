### What I Learned
Prior to the Constitutional convention in 1787, the United States had the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union which called for states to create their own currencies and handle their own foreign affairs when engaging in military conflict. The material goes out of its way once again to bring up contentious topic on the far extreme of "healthcare" (this debate always ends in a discussion on health insurance) and legalized weed. Of these two only one really deals with big government and the other one is pretty much a state issue.

### Learning Objectives:
Describe the structure and powers of the national government under the Articles of Confederation.

### Key Terms
#### Political Ideologies
- Philosophies about the structure, power, and purpose of government; American political ideologies include progressive, liberal, moderate, independent, conservative, and libertarian

### What I Learned
10 minute video from Nebula extra history talking about how the radicals and loyalists of the original colonies came together in 1774 to create a rebuke of the King of Britain and their goods. This sparked a revolutionary war, and 6 months later, they wrote another letter. No names were given for these letters. The colonists had created an army and given George Washington command. However, independence had not been declared. Brittain rejected the colonies and the colonies became states under the "continental congress". RI even declared itself a nation lol. Backtracking from 1774 to 1754 - because the video doesn't want to follow a straight timeline - we see where the colonies couldn't agree on a central government and reject Benjamin Franklin's first attempt at a unionizing plan, this led to his writing of The Articles of Confederation that was presented to the second Continental Congress. Enter John Dickenson in 1776, he takes the Articles of Confederation and edits it and gives the United States of America its name. The Declaration of Independence has now been drafted and the states want to "ship it" first. Dickenson resigns because he doesn't want to vote against the Articles but doesn't want to vote for the Declaration. The video says taht Dickenson's version of the articles is "ripped to shreds" but doesn't say by who who does the updating to it. The basterdized version is the version that gets ratified. 

For the record, I only recognize two of the creators that make up Nebula and they are all YouTube personalities with one of them being a lawyer. The others are all musicians or creators. Upon searching, they all have a leftist bias as well. I think I just wasted my time.

A confederation was created instead of a republic because many believe the US to be too big to be ruled effectively as a republic and that the resulting "elected leaders" may be too powerful. The material states that this government "proved to be dangerous and innefficient for a new country" but doesn't epxlain what dangerous or innefficient mean here in this context. 

### Key Terms
There were none because this video wasted my time.

## <a id="#gotac">4.2 Government Under The Articles of Confederation</a>
### What I Learned

The Second Continental Congress met with delegates for the 13 colonies (now states) to work to create a centrailized government that could provide for the common defense (so to speak), get foreign aid, and negotiate treaties; but not so powerful that it took away the (now) state's rights. This resulted in the Articles of Confederation. Note the Declaration did not create a government, it was just a nice "screw you" letter to the king of Britain.

### Key Terms

#### Articles of Confederation
- The first attempt at organizing the government of the United States, consisting of a unicameral (one-chamber) Congress; did not permit Congress to tax, regulate foreign or interstate commerce, or enforce its laws; failed as it formed an alliance of sovereign states with too weak a national government
#### Delegates
- People given the authority to make decisions on the behalf of a group

## <a id="#cng1">4.3 Creating a New Government 1</a>

### What I Learned
Each state had a governor and republican form of government and the material wants to make sure that white people are villified as slavers, because you can't have a liberal arts history class with out telling white people they are evil. 

State government at this time was favored over national government because Articles were the primary national document. 

There was a one chamber congress and no executive of judicial branches of government.

The congress under the Articles was limited to the following powers, which the material is really speaking negatively about so clearly in favor of big government: 
- exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and Native peoples
- declare war
- coin currency and borrow money
- settle disputes between states.

Regardless of the number of delegates sent to the congress, each state only got one vote and delegates could only serve 3 consecutive years. 9 out of 13 votes were required for the congress to act. <- I like that they had term limits at least ...

### Learning Check Questions
1. How is a unicameral congress different from a bicameral congress?
- [ ] A unicameral congress does not have the power to make treaties with foreign countries but a bicameral congress has treaty-making power.
- [x] A unicameral congress has one chamber, while a bicameral congress has two.
- [ ] A unicameral congress is structured to limit states' power, while a bicameral congress is structured to expand states' powers.
- [ ] A unicameral congress has very limited powers and authority, while a bicameral congress has more power and authority.

2. What was the basis of representation in Congress under the Articles of Confederation?
- [ ] Each state was allowed only two members.
- [x] Each state had one vote in Congress.
- [ ] States had equal representation in the upper house and representation based on population in the lower house.
- [ ] States were given representation based on population.

### Key Terms
#### Bicameral Legislature
- a legislative branch that consists of two separate chambers or two separately elected groups of officials, such as senators and representatives, like the Virginia Plan; bi, meaning "two," and camera, meaning "chamber," are Latin

### What I Learned
The material lists the pwers under the Articles which I'll list here but the information is in the material and I'm not copying and pasting. 
- The power to borrow and coing money
- The power to declare war
- The power to Make Treaties and Alliances with other Nations
- The power to Regulate Trade and Native Peoples
- The power to settle disputes among other states

Issues with this form of government
- They could not enforce their powers with no executive branch
- Only the states could draft new laws. 
- Only the states could tax citizens meaning the central government had to always borrow money from the states to cover debts. 
- No central military, meaning states had to supply soldiers.

### Did I complete the learning objectives for this section?

### Do I have any further questions or thoughts?

The material alludes to the fact that a single person would need to be an enforcer of the new law which is funny because it's like everyone expected a king or president like the Constitution provides later. The material has the benefit of hindsight but I don't believe everyone thought there should be one executive at this time. Im curious if there was a debate around that or if the material will cover anything regarding how the decision for the executive branch was made.
