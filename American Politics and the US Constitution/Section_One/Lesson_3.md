## <a id="intro">2 Introduction</a>

### What I Learned
Material states that "one could argue" that the ideas in Declaration of Independence line up with John Locke, but the ideas shift in favor of Montesquieu for both the Constitution and Bill of Rights, with some of Locke's ideas "infiltrating" (material's words) the Bill of Rights. <- This kind of language makes me continue to think there's going to be a bait in switch in terms of John Locke. The material paints the two as disagreeing with one another and changes the discussion to Anit-Fedarilist vs. Federalists. 

Two questions asked and two opinions lobbied by Federalists and Anti-Federalists about liberty and majority rule.
1. How much liberty should there be?
2. To what extent should "majority rule" be allowed?

Anti-Federalists want as much of both and Federalistss are for restraints for both.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Describe the influence of Enlightenment ideas on the founding documents

### Key Terms

- The original document, authored principally by Thomas Jefferson, that "birthed" the United States and started the Revolutionary War; lists important natural rights and grievances against the king of England, declares independence.

#### Bill of Rights
- The first 10 ammendments to the U.S. Constitutio, ratified in 1792; they list citizens' civil liberties and civil rights.

- [ ] Wealth
- [ ] Property
- [ ] Voting

### Key Terms

#### Sovereignty
- the principle that a government has the authority to manage its political affairs within its own geographical boundaries
(I would argue this is a highly contextual definition given the nature of the content but not a strict definition)

## <a id="con">3.2 The United States Constitution</a>

### What I Learned
The mention of Shay's Rebellion makes me think I should learn more about this later. This is mentioned to make the point that a pure democracy is a "mob rule" mentality and was almost the result of Shay's Rebellion. 

James Madison seems to make an argument away from Popular Will in *Federalist No. 10* in favor of representative government according to the material. The phrasing and paragraph breaks are strange here so I need to read more on this.

The Constitution implements Montesquieu's ideas of separating powers to create checks and balances where factional power checks factional power; factional power being self-interested. However, the constitution removes certain sovereign powers from the states, such removing the states from dealing in foreign affairs. 

Congress has something called the "Necessary and Proper Clause" which gives it it's autority in executing it's enumerated powers. 

Natural rights such as life, liberty and property are widely missing in the Constitution. And BOOM! this is the bait and switch. Here the material states that due to Jame Madison's commentary in Federalist no. 51 - which we only have one line of text in the material and no context - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are at odds like Montesquieu and Locke. The material reasons that liberty can be sacrificed in the pursuit of justice. I'm not buying this right now. I'm not completely in agreement that James Madison has the full authority to actually say this about the Contitution and what the founding fathers as a whole thought. Also to note, the Declaration and the Constituion are two wholely different documents created for different reasons and to address different things and comparing the two in the manner in which the material does seems very dubious. The material does offer once sentence at the very end which offers some thoughts as to the motivation of the Constitution. 

### Learning Check Questions
1. Which Constitutional principle, suggested by Montesquieu, lessens the potential harm of the national government over the people?
- [ ] Civil society
- [ ] Natural rights
- [x] A bicameral legislature
- [ ] Separation of powers
The Constitutional principle of bicameralism was meant to counterbalance the power of factions over the government by making each chamber of Congress obligated to different social groups.


2. Which Constitutional system, suggested by Montesquieu, balances the national government and allows each branch of government to limit the power of the other two branches?
- [ ] A bicameral legislature
- [x] Checks and balances
- [ ] Separation of powers
- [ ] Natural rights
The Constitutional system of checks and balances is meant to prevent any one branch of government from gaining complete power and control over the government by allowing each branch to monitor and influence what happens in other branches of government.

### Key Terms

#### Bicameral Legislature:
- A lawmaking body (group) in the legislative branch that consists of two separate chambers or two separately elected groups of officials, such as senators and representatives, like the Virginia Plan; bi, meaning "two," and camera, meaning "chamber," are Latin

#### Legislature
- The official lawmaking body of a government

#### Habeas Corpus
- Meaning, in Latin, "Show me the body"; this is the right for a jailed citizen to appear before a judge to hear about a criminal charge; prohibits imprisoning people without due process of law

#### Enumerate Rights
- Rights given to the federal government by the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) to regulate the interstate and foreign commerce, raise and support armies, declare ware, coin money, and conduct foreign affairs

## <a id="bor">3.3 The Bill of Rights</a>
### What I Learned
Some backlash occurred during the ratification process of the Constitution. The material says that those who were committed to the Declaration were called Anti-Federalist and opposed ratification. <- So the material has set up a dichotomy between the Declaration and the Constitution and now we're going to pick sides. No actual evidence is provided here and I'm starting to worry about this information. The material mentions that the Bill of Rights is a response to the Anti-Federalists. Although this seems to be the case based off of some other reading, I must say that the lack of a mention of Patrick Henry and his note-worthy contributions make me a little sad. This material is certainly setting up the reader to believe that the Bill of Rights is not that important and that the Anti-Federalists were the "bad guys". 

The material is now going on a tyraid fo sorts while interepetting whether each ammendment is "Lockean" or "Montesquieuian". This wouldn't be a thing you would even need to do if you hadn't set up the dichotomy in earlier material. It also says things like "deprived of life, liberty or property" if due process of law is followed. I don't think this is a fair representation either and perhaps that is why the material also puts the comment in quotations. 

### Learning Check Qeustiosns
1. Which of the following protects Locke's idea of natural rights and provides Montesquieu's protections known as due process of law?
- [ ] The Constitution
- [ ] The Declaration of Independence
- [ ] The Articles of Confederation
- [x] The Bill of Rights

### Key Terms

#### Ratification
- Approval or confirmation

## <a id="q-s">Quiz and Summary</a>

### What I Learned
Now in the summary I'm seeing statements like this, "The transition from Locke to Montesquieu is a shift from natural rights to procedural rights." This is annoying because it presupposes the reader is in agreement about a "shift". Procedural rights is now a thing being talked about that was not mentioned at all before and is not a key term, however, we're supposed to believe these are rights that are created by people and provided by government. This is definitely a set up. I dont' agree here at all. 

At the end of the summary, we continue with this idea of liberty being at the center of everything and whether it is a natural right or a procedural right. This is ludicrous because this si now certainly a set up that says government has the right to take your liberty and that's its not natural. It also says that this Lockean idea is one that still centeral to American politics and is not easily "surrendered" as if it should be. **I'm legitimately ticked off by this notion.**

### Did I complete the learning objectives for this section?


### Do I have any further questions?
Yeah, can I speak to the absolute butthole who wrote this section? I mean they are trying to convince me by the end of it that liberty is a "procedural right" that the government can take away and it may be subtle but's completely true of what they did. I'm super peeved right now.
