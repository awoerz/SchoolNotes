## Course Introduction

### Summary
The provided text introduces the field of Integrated Physical Sciences, emphasizing the diverse and interconnected nature of physics, chemistry, and earth science. It highlights the fundamental relationships governing natural phenomena and the practical applications of scientific knowledge. The passage also discusses the role of scientists in studying nonliving systems, distinguishing physical science from life science. Physics, focusing on forces and energy, is the first discipline explored, followed by chemistry, which delves into atoms and molecules. Earth science, the third discipline, examines Earth's structure and processes, including volcanic and seismic activities, and extends to the study of other planets. The interdependence of these physical science disciplines is underscored, illustrating how scientists in different fields collaborate to make discoveries and enhance our understanding of the natural world.

Q: Question: Explain what is meant by the physical sciences. How are they different from life sciences? Which disciplines make up the physical sciences?

A: Physical science studies nonliving systems, as opposed to life science, which studies living systems. Physics, chemistry, and earth and space sciences are all physical sciences

### Key Terms

physics: the study of forces and energy

chemistry: the study of atoms and molecules

earth science: the study of Earthâ€™s structure and composition, as well as the processes that change Earth
