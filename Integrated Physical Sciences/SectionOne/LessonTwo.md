# Understanding Scientific Data

## Lesson 2 Intro

Keep in mind: 
Evaluate graphs and data tables to identify relationships between variables.

## Lesson 2.1 Correlations Between Variables

### Did I Get This?

Q: A student records the amount of sugar that can be dissolved in water at four different temperatures. The amount of sugar that dissolves increases with increasing temperature. How would you describe these variables?

A:
- [ ] No correlation
- [ ] Inversely proportional
- [x] Directly proportional

Q: A student measures the volume of a rubber ball subjected to increasing values of uniform pressure. The volume of the ball decreases as the pressure increases. How would you describe these variables?

A: 
- [x] Inversely proportional
- [ ] Directly proportional
- [ ] No correlation

### Key Terms

- direct proportionality: a mathematical relationship between two variables whose ratio remains constant as their numerical values change  (synonymous with positive correlation)
- inverse proportionality: a mathematical relationship between variables in which an increase in the value of one causes a decrease in the value of the other (synonymous with negative correlation)
- no correlation: a lack of relationship between variables on a graph; a change in one value does not affect the other
- proportionality constant: a parameter that quantifies the relative changes in variables that are directly or inversely proportional
- origin of the plot: the point on a graph where the value of both x and y axes are zero
- scatterplot: a type of graph comparing two variables as data points in Cartesian, x-y coordinates

## Lesson 2.2 Correlation and Causality

### Did I Get This?

Q: Increasing temperature is associated with higher humidity levels in lake environments. That is, the temperature is positively correlated with humidity levels. What is the likely cause of this correlation?

A:
- [x] Increases in temperature cause an increase in the lake's evaporation rate
- [ ] Temperature increases convert dust into water, thus increasing local humidity
- [ ] Higher temperatures cause oxygen and hydrogen to react to form water, thereby increasing humidity

### Learn By Doing

A Graph showing "Amount of Sugar Disolved" in grams on the Y-axis in intervals of 100 from 0 to 500. Temperature in degrees Clecius on the X-axis with intervals of 20 from 0 to 100. 

Data Points (Temperature, Sugar): (0, 190), (25, 205), (78, 320), (100, 480).

Q: What is the independent variable of this graph?

A: 
- [ ] Temperature
- [x] Amount of sugar dissolved

Q: Does this graph show a correlation? If so, what type of correlation?

A: 
- [x] Yes, the amount of sugar dissolved is positively correlated with temperature.
- [ ] Yes, the amount of sugar is negatively correlated with temperature.
- [ ] No, there is no correlation.

A Graph showing "Water Level In Pan" in mm on the Y-axis in intervals of 100 from 0 to 400. Time in days in intervals of 10 from 0 to 50. 

Data Points (Time, Water): (0, 400), (10, 340), (20, 260), (30, 180), (40, 110), (50, 70)

Q: Which type of correlation does the graph show?

A: 
- [ ] Positive correlation
- [x] Negative correlation

Q: What is the best description of the causal relationship between these variables?

A:
- [ ] The amount of water is increasing over time due to rain.
- [x] Longer periods of evaporation remove more water.
- [ ] The passage of time makes water disappear.

### Key Terms

- ratio: a quantity that compares the values of two variables expressed as a fraction
