# Mehtods of Scientific Inquiry

## Lesson 1 Intro

Keep in mind: 
Describing the mehtods of scientific inquiry.

## Lesson 1.1 Scientific Investigations

To determine if something is science, it must or may have the following attributes: 
- studies the natural world
- uses ideas that can be tested
- relies on data gathered from observations or experiments
- is presented for evaluation to others in the scientific community
- leads to further questions and research

Did I Get This? 
Your friend goes to a rock concert and the next day tells you enthusiastically that it was the best music ever made. Can your friend's claim be studied using the methods of science?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No - Because this is based on an opinion and cannot be studdied using methods of science.

## Leson 1.2 Controlled Experiments

### Learn By Doing: 

In the setup for an experiment, the height of a ramp is h. The height of a table is y. The horizontal distance the ball travels after it leaves the table is x. You want to try to get the ball to land inside the cup so you want to know how changing the height of the ramp affects how far from the table the ball lands. In other words, you want to know how h affects x.

Q: Which type of variable is height (h)? 

A: Independent

Q: Which type of variable is the horizontal distance (x)?

A: Dependent

Q: Which type of variable is the the material of the ball (glass, plastic, rubber, etc.)?

A: Control

Q: Which type of variable is the table height (y)?

A: Control

Q: In general, metal wires expand when they are heated. To test this, you heat a piece of wire and then measure how much the wire’s length changed as a result of the temperature change. In this experiment, what is the wire’s temperature?

A: An Independent Variable

### Did I Get This?

Q: In the soil example described at the beginning of this lesson, explain why the type of soil is the independent variable.

A: In this experiment, you intentionally change the type of soil and observe what happens to the absorption time. You design the experiment this way because you think that the type of soil directly affects how long it takes the water to be absorbed. Therefore, the soil type is the independent variable, and the water absorption rate is the dependent variable.

### Key Terms

- controlled experiment: an experiment in which a scientist intentionally changes one quantity and observes how another quantity changes
- variables: the changing quantities in an experiment
- independent variable: the variable that is changed by the experimenter in an experiment
- dependent variable: the variable that changes because of the independent variable
- control variable: the variable that scientists do not wish to study that needs to either be eliminated or kept constant

## Lesson 1.3 Observational Studies

### Learn By Doing

Q: A student records the rising and setting times of the moon each day for a month.

A: Observational Study

Q: Scientists at a volcano observatory continuously monitor the ground movements and volcanic gas chemistry between and during eruptions.

A: Observational Study

Q: A group of students sprinkle salt onto one of two burning candles and record the color of the two flames.

A: Controlled Expiriment

Q: When scientists want to determine the hardness of minerals, they use a test called the Mohs test. An experimenter trying to identify a mineral will scratch the surface with a set of tools of various hardness and then analyze the results against charts.

A: Controlled Expiriment

Q: The first evidence that light has a finite speed and does not travel from place to place instantaneously came in the 17th century from observations that Jupiter’s moons appear later when Jupiter is farther from Earth as compared to when Jupiter is closer to Earth. This phenomenon was used to show that the difference in the time of appearance of the moons is consistent with a measurable speed. What is this is an example of?

A: An observational study

### Did I Get This?

Q: What is an example of a laboratory study?

A:
- [ ] Scientists climb on top of a mountain to study how a rock formation originated.
- [ ]  Scientists notice there are fewer fish in a lake, so they measure the pH of the pond water to check for any pollutants.
- [ ]  Scientists in Tokyo measure the speed of seismic waves propagating from below Arkansas through the Earth’s crust.
- [x]  Scientists combine two organic substances in a test tube and measure the amount of product that forms.

Q:  You heard somewhere that salty water boils faster than pure water. You decide to do a scientific investigation to determine whether this is true. You get three identical pots. You put 4 cups of pure water in the first pot. In the second pot, you put 4 cups of water with 2 tablespoons of salt added. In the third pot, you put 4 cups of water with 4 tablespoons of salt added. Next, you heat all three pots at the same level of heat and measure how long it takes the water in each pot to boil. What type of experiment is this?

A: Controlled

Q: The time needed for the water in each pot to boil depends on several factors, such as the amount of liquid you use, the level of heat you use, and the size and composition of the pots you use. In this experiment, these are examples of variables. In this experiment, what type of variable is the salinity (concentration of salt) of the water?

A: Independent

### Key Terms

- observational studies: experiments in which systems are observed as they appear in nature, and researchers do not attempt to change them
- field studies: observational studies done outside a laboratory setting
- laboratory studies: experiments that take place in a highly controlled, artificial setting

## Lesson 1.4 Scientific Models

### Learn By Doing

Q: A group of scientists studies the nature of earthquakes by passing mechanical waves through various materials in a lab. Which type of model are the scientists are using?

A: Physical

Q: Which type of model is Newton’s second law of motion, which explains the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, F=ma?

A: Mathematical

Q: Which type of model is a picture of the solar system an example of?

A: Conceptual

### Did I Get This?

Q: Which type of model is a light bulb used to model the sun as a source of energy an example of?

A: 
- [ ] Conceptual model
- [x] Physical model
- [ ] Mathematical model

Q: Which model could be used to illustrate rocket propulsion?

A: 
- [ ] A scotch mint (large, round white mint candy) is dropped into a bottle of diet soda, which causes bubbles to form and an eruption to happen
- [x] A balloon filled with air with its stem pinched but not tied, which is then released so the balloon moves opposite the direction in which the air is ejected
- [ ] Ice crystals forming in a sealed chamber
- [ ] A coiled spring held by two people at opposite ends of a hallway being shaken up and down

### Key Terms

- physical model: a model that represents a real object or a phenomenon, usually on a smaller scale
- conceptual model: a model that can be used to visualize things that cannot be seen, such as atoms
- mathematical model: a model that describes physical objects or phenomena using mathematical methods
- computer model: a model that uses computers to explain and predict complex systems, such as weather patterns and the detailed movements of objects in the solar system
